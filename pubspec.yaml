# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # example:

          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 400
